## My Rental Analysis and Dashboard

I completed the Rental Analysis in the first Jupyter Notebook. Creating the dashboard was more more challegning than I anticipated. I was not able to figure out how to add the line chart of prices by neighborhood.

I organized the dashboard as follows:

*  First Tab:  Average Values for housing units, gross rent and sales price per square foot
*   Second Tab: Data on San Francisco's top ten most expensive neighborhoods
*   Third Tab: Interactive maps of San Franciscos neighborhoods showing rent and sales price per square foot
